Tips for allergy patient:

1.Identify the culprit.
Although most people are aware of seasonal allergies,
many cannot pinpoint the culprit. Keeping a log regarding symptom onset,
time of day, and environmental surroundings helps narrow the list.
Patients’ symptoms often vary in intensity from day to day,
further complicating assessment.
Patients with ongoing allergies should see a specialist,
even if symptoms are mild. The intensity of current allergic reactions
does not necessarily predict the intensity of future attacks.

2.Address unproven treatments.
A quick Internet search uncovers a host of unproven diagnostics and
treatments for allergies, including hair analysis, acupuncture, and herbal medicine.
Most lack adequate studies and some, such as “cytotoxic” food testing
(mixing blood with a food extract to determine if the cells swell),
make no sense given current knowledge of the immune system.
Unproven treatments are not necessarily harmless; some can do real harm.
Discourage patients from trying these treatments without first discussing them with
their physician.
