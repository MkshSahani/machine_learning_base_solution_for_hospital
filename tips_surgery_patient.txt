Tips from you surgeon:

1.Prevent Infection

Preventing infection is one of the simplest things that
you can do to have an excellent outcome from your procedure.
Washing your hands before touching your incision is one of the
easiest and most important things you can do during your recovery.

2. Inspect Your Incision

Looking at your incision may not be your favorite thing to do,
but it is important that you take a good look at your incision
several times a day. Now there are procedures where this isnâ€™t possible,
but for the vast majority of procedures,
a mirror makes it possible to have a good look at the surgical site.
Is your incision pink or red? Is there wound drainage and what color is it?
Are the stitches or staples intact? These questions are very important and
looking at your incision several times a day will help you determine if your
surgical site is continuing to heal or if it has become infected.
