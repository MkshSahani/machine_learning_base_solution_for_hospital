Tips from Psychitrist:

1.Actually try writing your thoughts down:
You don’t need to do anything in-depth or lengthy—just take five minutes or
so a day to write down your thoughts, feelings, or ideas.
This can be especially helpful if you want to keep track of changes in your
moods or behavior over time (maybe to discuss with a therapist later).
But it can also just be a place to work through something in a private,
non-judgey space—something that you may not feel comfortable talking about just yet.

2.When you're super stressed and overwhelmed,
see if there's any way to put a positive spin on it.
Still, Dr. Clark says you can take those moments when you’re totally overwhelmed
and try to look for the good in them. For example,
if you’re stressed because you’re up against an intense work deadline,
think about how that stress is actually helping to push you to get it done.
“The sensation of pressure doesn’t have to be negative—it can be a positive challenge
and motivating,” Dr. Clark says.
Or, if you don't have a free weekend to yourself in the next two months,
consider how it's pretty great that you've got such a rich social life these days.
In many cases, it's all about how you view it.
