Tips for the medicine patient

1. Keep an eye on your weight. Rapid unintentional weight loss is often a sign something
serious is up.
Or [weight] gain, adds another Redditor.
I was in the ER last night. Overheard [the] guy in front of me [say] that
he gained around 30 pounds in two weeks and could no longer walk. Based off his
swollen abdomen and wet lungs, I thought he was in congestive heart failure.
He was roomed near me and it turns out that’s exactly what he has.

2.Your immune system is one of the greatest assets you have, and you never thank it.
In your life, your body will autonomously eradicate between six to 10 cancers without
your realizing. It will fight your infections, repair microtraumas,
and police the entire population of billions of cells in your body without your asking.
All it requests in return is a little bit of health to preserve it. Stop smoking,
lose weight. Maybe exercise a little. Don’t drink so much.
Your diet is so much more important than you realize.
