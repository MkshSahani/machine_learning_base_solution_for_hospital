Tips for Eyes:

1. Have regular sight tests

As well as an eye health check,
a sight test might help detect signs of underlying general health conditions,
such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
Everyone should have a sight test every two years,
or more often if your optometrist recommends it.

2.Eat healthily

Eating a healthy, balanced diet reduces your risk of eye disease.
Include lots of omega-3 fats, found in oily fish, and lutein, found in dark-green,
leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale. Vitamins A, C and E are also helpful,
so eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.
If you have a family history of macular degeneration (losing central vision in the eyes),
ask your optometrist about taking nutritional supplements.


3.Stop smoking

Many people are unaware of the link between smoking and eye disease.
If you smoke, stop. Smoking significantly increases the risk of developing eye diseases,
such as cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. However long you have smoked
itâ€™s never too late to benefit from quitting.
Wear prescribed glasses
