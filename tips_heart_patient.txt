Tips for good heart

1.Stop smoking. Tobacco use is a major risk factor for heart disease.
It damages the walls of the blood vessels.
It can prevent blood and oxygen from reaching your heart and other organs.
It also can cause blood clots, which may lead to heart attacks.
Nicotine, the main chemical in tobacco, raises your blood pressure.
If you smoke, ask your doctor to help you make a plan to quit.
In addition to not smoking, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
You can inhale smoke from a burning cigarette or when someone else exhales smoke.

2.Control your blood pressure.
High blood pressure puts stress on your heart and blood vessels.
Talk to your doctor about ways to manage your blood pressure.
This includes exercising, keeping a diet that is low in salt,
and losing weight if you are overweight. Your doctor may also
prescribe medicines to help control your blood pressure.
It is important to follow your doctor’s orders for all medicines

3. What to do after heart attack

After a heart attack, you will want to go back to your regular life.
This especially can be true if you spent time in the hospital.
However, the answer depends on your normal routine and the condition of your heart.
It’s important to start slowly to give your heart a chance to heal.
Your doctor will talk to you about when you can be active again and what you should do.
Do not return to any kind of exercise without talking to your doctor first.
It also is important to sign up for a cardiac rehabilitation program.
This monitors your blood pressure, heart rate, and heartbeat as you exercise.
